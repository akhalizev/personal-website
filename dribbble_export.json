      "description": "<p>My submission to this panorama rebound experiment.\n I live in Minneapolis, Minnesota, so here are a couple famous buildings and a sign of Prince, the most famous Minneapolis citizen.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to the following for participating and contributing to this experiment:</p>\n\n<p>@Evoria \n @Sander de Wekker \n @Dmitriy Mir \n @Bizhan Khodabandeh \n @Lisa Romano \n @Austin Johnson \n @Irine Gubanova a.k.a. bc999 \n @Tanya Kremnova</p>\n\n<p>Please check out their profiles and give them a follow.</p>\n\n<p>---</p>\n\n<p>You are invited to participate in this interactive design challenge. Anyone can participate but please follow the rules below.</p>\n\n<p>RULES:</p>\n\n<p>Download the attached AI file and add to the left or right of the panorama to extend the scene as long as you:</p>\n\n<p>1. Do not change any part of the image added by another designer except for very minor alterations to make your addition look seamless.</p>\n\n<p>2. Do not make the illustration taller. Keep it panoramic.</p>\n\n<p>3. Only add up to 800 pixels of width.</p>\n\n<p>4. You may add colors as you see fit, even to previous work as long as you don't change the lines or change existing color fills or outline colors.</p>\n\n<p>5. Use 3-pixel line weight</p>\n\n<p>6. There are no limits on the subject matter and no requirement that your work follows the same theme as what has been done before. The weirder (more creative) the better.</p>\n\n<p>After you add your own illustration, upload to Dribbble as a rebound of this image. For your Dribbble shot, use only YOUR addition or part thereof.</p>\n\n<p>Rename the AI file.</p>\n\n<p>The AI file is named using the date, in reverse: panorama-YYYY-MM-DD-v#.ai</p>\n\n<p>So change the file name keeping the \"panorama-\" then add the year (2018) - month number - day number - version number. So if the version you download has \"v3\" then you would increase that to \"v4\" and so on.</p>\n\n<p>Send the AI file to scott(at)atomiclotus(dot)net so I can add it to this post for future participants.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
